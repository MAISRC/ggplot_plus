\title{Subtle, Minimal Gridlines For When and Where They Help}
\usage{
gridlines_plus(color = "gray90", linewidth = 1.2, linetype = "solid")
}
\arguments{
\item{color}{Gridline color. Single character string. Default: \code{"gray90"}.}

\item{linewidth}{Gridline width (theme line units). Single numeric. Default: \code{1.2}.}

\item{linetype}{Gridline type. Single string (e.g., \code{"solid"}, \code{"dashed"}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"gridlines_plus"} that you add to a plot with \code{+}.
}
\description{
Adds light, major gridlines along only axes that are mapped to
continuous variables (never on discrete axes). Minor gridlines are
blanked. This enables the benefits of gridlines but minimizes clutter.
Works with local/global mappings, derived continuous axes
(e.g., histograms), and respects \code{coord_flip()}.
}
\details{
Under the hood, \code{gridlines_plus()} checks layer and/or global mappings to
see if \code{x} and/or \code{y} are continuous. If needed (e.g., for derived axes like
histograms), it briefly builds the plot to inspect the trained panel scales.
It then turns on \strong{major} gridlines for continuous directions and explicitly
blanks gridlines for the others (including \strong{all minor} gridlines).
