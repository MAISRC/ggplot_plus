\alias{switch_axis_label}
\title{Place a Y Axis Title on a ggplot in a Safe Place Above the Y Axis Line.}
\usage{
switch_axis_label(p, location = "top", move_top_legend_down = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{A ggplot object built using ggplot_build whose y axis title will be moved.}

\item{location}{A length-1 character string matching either "top" or "bottom" for the placement of the new y axis title. Defaults to \code{"top"}. Potentially overridden by whatever is specified to \code{y_axis_title_plus()}'s parameter of the same name when it's called.}

\item{move_top_legend_down}{A length-1 logical indicating whether a top legend (if any) should be moved down to be in the same row as the relocated y axis title (where they could clip into each other). Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object compatible with \code{ggplot2}'s + command structure.
}
\description{
This function relocates the y axis title of a ggplot graph to the top of the plot, above the y axis line and left-justified to the left edge of the y axis labels, sort of like a plot subtitle. It also orients the text horizontally for space-efficiency and easy reading. This is otherwise difficult to do using \code{ggplot2}'s default styling tools. This is the main function used by \code{y_axis_title_plus()} to ultimately accomplish its purpose.
This function is used internally by the \code{ggplot_gtable.switched()} method and is not intended for separate use.
