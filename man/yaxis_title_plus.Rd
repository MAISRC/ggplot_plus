\title{Relocate a Y Axis Title to Above the Y Axis on a ggplot and Turn it Horizontal.}
\usage{
yaxis_title_plus(location = "top")
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{A length-1 character string matching either "top" or "bottom" for the placement of the new y axis title. Defaults to \code{"top"}. \code{"bottom"} should generally only be used when the x axis labels (which would occupy the same row as the new y axis title) have been moved to the top of the graph.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of class "axis_switcher", which will trigger the ggplot_add method by the same name.
}
\description{
This function relocates the y axis title of a ggplot graph to the top of the plot, above the y axis line and left-justified to the left edge of the y axis labels, sort of like a plot subtitle. It also orients the text horizontally for space-efficiency and easy reading. This is otherwise difficult to do using \code{ggplot2}'s default styling tools.

\examples{
ggplot2::ggplot(iris, ggplot2::aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length)) +
geom_plus(geom = "point") +
