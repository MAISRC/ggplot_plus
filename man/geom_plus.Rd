\arguments{
\item{geom}{The name of the geom being drawn. Corresponds to the portion of the geom_ function after the _, e.g., "point" for geom_point, "line" for geom_line, etc. Must be a length one character string, and must match an implemented geom. See names(geom_plus_defaults) for a list of these. Required input.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed along to the geom_ function being called.}

\item{include_theme}{Should a call to \code{theme_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_gridlines}{Should a call to \code{gridlines_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_ytitle_plus}{Should a call to \code{yaxis_title_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_xscale_plus}{Should a call to \code{scale_x_continuous_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_yscale_plus}{Should a call to \code{scale_y_continuous_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_fillscale_plus}{Should a call to \code{scale_fill_continuous_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{include_colorscale_plus}{Should a call to \code{scale_color_continuous_plus()} with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to include it.}

\item{x_title, y_title, color_title, size_title, shape_title, alpha_title, fill_title}{A string to use for the graph's legend title for the corresponding aesthetic. Defaults to \code{NULL} and will be ignored unless a length-1 string. Internally, this passes the new title to \code{ggplot2::labs()} to circumvent around calling a \verb{scale_*} function, which might overwrite intended behaviors.}

\item{silence_warnings}{\code{geom_plus()} triggers some checks for aspects of good graph design and, if any of these checks fail, a warning is triggered to direct the user towards better practices. Set this parameter to \code{FALSE} to silence these warnings. To set TRUE as the default for the current session, run \code{options(geom_plus_silence_warnings = TRUE)}.}
}
\value{
List with the class "geom_plus", which will trigger the geom_plus method in ggplot_add.
}
\description{
Maps inputs to a base ggplot geom (e.g., geom_point or geom_line) but provides default values more likely to adhere to best practices around usability, design aesthetics, and accessibility.
}
\details{
If you map the \strong{shape} aesthetic, \code{geom_plus()} automatically adds
\code{ggplot2::scale_shape_manual()} with the palette of shapes = 21â€“25.

If you later add your own \verb{scale_shape_*()} layer, it will \emph{replace}
the default palette with a warning.

To change only the legend title while keeping the default palette,
use the \code{shape_title} argument or \code{ggplot2::labs()} instead of adding a new scale.

A similar pattern occurs with fill and color, as these are governed by
\verb{scale_fill_viridis_*()} or \verb{scale_color_viridis_*()}, respectively.
See \code{?palettes_plus()} for details.
