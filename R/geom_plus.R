#' Generates Base Geoms With Elevated Defaults
#'
#' Maps inputs to a base ggplot geom (e.g., geom_point or geom_line) but provides default values more likely to adhere to best practices around usability, design aesthetics, and accessibility.
#'
#' @param geom The name of the geom being drawn. Corresponds to the portion of the geom_ function after the _, e.g., "point" for geom_point, "line" for geom_line, etc. Must be a length one character string, and must match an implemented geom. See names(geom_plus_defaults) for a list of these. Required input.
#' @param ... Other arguments to be passed along to the geom_ function being called.
#' @param include_theme Should a call to `theme_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_gridlines Should a call to `gridlines_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_ytitle_plus Should a call to `yaxis_title_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_xscale_plus Should a call to `scale_x_continuous_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_yscale_plus Should a call to `scale_y_continuous_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_fillscale_plus Should a call to `scale_fill_continuous_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param include_colorscale_plus Should a call to `scale_color_continuous_plus()` with no arguments be automatically applied to the ggplot command chain, without needing to be called separately? Defaults to `FALSE`. Set to `TRUE` to include it.
#' @param x_title,y_title,color_title,size_title,shape_title,alpha_title,fill_title A string to use for the graph's legend title for the corresponding aesthetic. Defaults to `NULL` and will be ignored unless a length-1 string. Internally, this passes the new title to `ggplot2::labs()` to circumvent around calling a `scale_*` function, which might overwrite intended behaviors.
#' @param silence_warnings `geom_plus()` triggers some checks for aspects of good graph design and, if any of these checks fail, a warning is triggered to direct the user towards better practices. Set this parameter to `FALSE` to silence these warnings. To set TRUE as the default for the current session, run `options(geom_plus_silence_warnings = TRUE)`.
#'
#' @details
#' If you map the **shape** aesthetic, `geom_plus()` automatically adds
#' `ggplot2::scale_shape_manual()` with the palette of shapes = 21â€“25.
#'
#' If you later add your own `scale_shape_*()` layer, it will *replace*
#' the default palette with a warning.
#'
#' To change only the legend title while keeping the default palette,
#' use the `shape_title` argument or `ggplot2::labs()` instead of adding a new scale.
#'
#' A similar pattern occurs with fill and color, as these are governed by
#' `scale_fill_viridis_*()` or `scale_color_viridis_*()`, respectively.
#' See `?palettes_plus()` for details.
#'
#' @return List with the class "geom_plus", which will trigger the geom_plus method in ggplot_add.
